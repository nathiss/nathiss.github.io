[{"content":"In the previous article from this series, we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about genetic algorithms and how they can be used to generate art. Now let\u0026rsquo;s put those ideas into action and focus on implementing the first part of our artistic toolset: mutators.\nPreparing the ecosystem Before we begin working on mutators, we need to prepare an environment in which our specimens can thrive. We don\u0026rsquo;t need much - right now the only thing is a generation. For the record, in this context, a generation is a collection of specimen which can be mutated, scored, and bred (basically experimented upon) to get us closer to the optimum. Since our specimens are images, they can be represented by the following structs:\nstruct Pixel { r: u8, g: u8, b: u8, } struct Image { height: usize, width: usize, pixels: Vec\u0026lt;Pixel\u0026gt;, } Representing each pixel as a 24-bit value gives us some flexibility here - it allows us to operate on two color depths: true color (which uses 24-bit colors) and grayscale (8-bit). Creating a grayscale pixel can be done by setting up all color channels to the same value. True, it uses thrice as much memory as it could, but\u0026hellip;\nPremature optimization is the root of all evil.\n~ Donald Knuth\nMethod of initializing 1 the generation will affect how fast we can search the solution space. As the algorithm produces more fitted images, the specimens get closed to the source image. But we don\u0026rsquo;t really care about how fast the optimum can be achieved, frankly, we don\u0026rsquo;t really care about achieving the optimum in the first place. It is the process of getting more fitted images and seeing how they evolve what\u0026rsquo;s really interesting. Therefore our generation will be initialized by blank images - images filled by white pixels. It will reduce pace of solution space search, but will produce images that are more visually interesting. We are here to do art, after all. üé®\nimpl Pixel { #[must_use] pub const fn white() -\u0026gt; Self { Pixel::new(255, 255, 255) } #[must_use] pub const fn new(r: u8, g: u8, b: u8) -\u0026gt; Self { Pixel { r, g, b } } } impl Image { #[must_use] pub fn new(height: usize, width: usize, pixels: Vec\u0026lt;Pixel\u0026gt;) -\u0026gt; Self { Self { height, width, pixels, } } #[must_use] pub fn blank(height: usize, width: usize, pixel: \u0026amp;Pixel) -\u0026gt; Self { let size = height * width; let pixels = vec![pixel.clone(); size]; Self::new(height, width, pixels) } } #[must_use] fn get_first_generation( vec_len: usize, image_height: usize, image_width: usize ) -\u0026gt; Vec\u0026lt;Image\u0026gt; { let pixel = Pixel::white(); vec![Image::blank(height, width, \u0026amp;pixel); vec_len] } This code takes care of initializing the generation. üëå\nThrowing dice and hoping for the best As was mentioned in the previous article, mutators act only on one specimen at a time, inserting random modification onto it. With that description alone, we can already define a contract for all mutators we\u0026rsquo;re going to implement:\npub trait Mutator { fn mutate(\u0026amp;self, image: \u0026amp;mut Image); } Why \u0026amp;self and not \u0026amp;mut self? Due to the fact that mutations are independent of one another, they can be performed concurrently. In fact, as we will see in the future articles, mutating and scoring are the only steps that can be easily run in parallel.\nA diagram showing the flow of actions applied on a single generation.\nThrowing a rectangular dice Rectangles are the easiest shape to draw both algorithmically and IRL; our first mutator will use rectangles as a mutation primitive. To generate a random rectangle we need have the following:\ncoordinates of one of its corners, width, height, fill color. Fill color is pretty straightforward, but other values have some constraints they need to meet. An image we\u0026rsquo;ll be mutating has width and height - let\u0026rsquo;s assume it\u0026rsquo;s n and m respectively. Coordinates of one of the corners, in our case it\u0026rsquo;s going to be top-left, are limited by the image dimensions. Width and height are limited by both image dimensions, and the coordinates we just generated.\n$$ x \\in \\lbrack 0 .. n \\lbrack \\newline y \\in \\lbrack 0 .. m \\lbrack \\newline width \\in \\lbrack 1 .. n - x + 1 \\lbrack \\newline height \\in \\lbrack 1 .. m - y + 1 \\lbrack \\newline $$\nWhy coordinates intervals are right-open? Because if the mutator selects the very right or bottom edge, then the rectangle would need to have zero width/height. By not right-closing the intervals, we ensure that there\u0026rsquo;s at least one pixel which can be mutated üëå. Similarly both width and height intervals are right-open to ensure that the rectangle will not overflow the image.\nstruct RandomRectangle { x: usize, y: usize, width: usize, height: usize, } #[must_use] fn get_random_rectangle(random: \u0026amp;mut Random, image: \u0026amp;Image) -\u0026gt; RandomRectangle { let image_width = image.width(); let image_height = image.height(); let x = random.get_random(0usize, image_width); let y = random.get_random(0usize, image_height); let width = random.get_random(0usize, image_width - x) + 1; let height = random.get_random(0usize, image_height - y) + 1; RandomRectangle { x, y, width, height, } } Function get_random_rectangle is a neat helper: based on the given RNG 2 and image, it returns a struct representing a random rectangle within the boundaries of the image.\nOnly two things left to do: generate random color and draw the shape. The implementation of rectangle mutator will look like this:\n#[derive(Debug, Default)] pub struct RectangleMutator; impl Mutator for RectangleMutator { fn mutate(\u0026amp;self, image: \u0026amp;mut Image) { let mut random = Random::default(); let rect = get_random_rectangle(\u0026amp;mut random, image); let r = random.get_random(0u8, 255); let g = random.get_random(0u8, 255); let b = random.get_random(0u8, 255); let image_width = image.width(); for j in rect.y..(rect.height + rect.y) { for i in rect.x..(rect.width + rect.x) { let pixel = \u0026amp;mut image[j * image_width + i]; pixel.r(r); pixel.g(g); pixel.b(b); } } } } The implementation is really simple. First we get a random rectangle (using the helper function), then generate color channels, and finally draw the shape. Drawing itself is done by two nested loops iterating over columns and rows of the image. With the two indexes it references a specific pixel: j * image_width + 1 and finally overrides it using the color channels.\nCool, let\u0026rsquo;s see what the program generates after 10 000 generations when initialized with Mona Lisa.\nMona Lisa (generation #10 000) Doesn\u0026rsquo;t really looks like anything. üòê\nWhich isn\u0026rsquo;t very surprising; the code did what it was suppose to do: it generated random rectangles on the white image. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t have any scoring logic yet (that\u0026rsquo;s a topic for another article) the resulting image is composed of random noise. We\u0026rsquo;ll need to wait a bit longer to get an image that even remotely reflects \u0026ldquo;Mona Lisa\u0026rdquo;.\nThrowing dice of other shapes It\u0026rsquo;d be nice to have mutators other than RectangleMutator, which are able to mutate images with different shapes, but I\u0026rsquo;m not going to cover them here. The reason is simple - they operate under the same rules: you need to define boundaries first and then you need to draw the desired shape. I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented two other mutators: TriangleMutator and CircleMutator. Their sources can be found here.\nAfterword You might\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that the code examples of this article are not strictly bounded together, meaning you cannot just copy them to have a working example. A bunch of things like: Random implementation, loading the original image, mutation loop, and the whole impl Image block are missing. If you want to have a working solution it\u0026rsquo;s here (locked down to the newest commit at the moment of writing - 73aa8da). The goal of this series is not to go through every single line of code to build a working utility, but rather to present an idea. So, moving forward all future articles from this series will also be done in that style.\nPhoto by Alexander Grey on Unsplash\nStay tuned üåä\nUsually the generation is generated randomly.

Drawing pictures is tedious. With programming, however, we can automate things. The point of automation is to reduce the amount of manual labor. So let\u0026rsquo;s mix evolution, DNA, and programming together to make art that makes itself. Pictures that draw themselves.\nConcepts and definitions Before we dive deep into making art, we need to understand some important concepts \u0026ndash; first things first. Automatic art 1, at its core, uses generic algorithms. Wikipedia has a really nice page about them, if you\u0026rsquo;d like to read it. However for the sake of the article this is enough:\nA Genetic Algorithm is an algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection used to find solutions for optimization problems. It has three main parts:\nMutation - during which specimens are randomly changed, Scoring - during which specimens are ranked by their \u0026ldquo;ability to adapt to their environment\u0026rdquo;, Crossing - during which one or more specimens are mixed together to produce a new member. OK. üëå\nWith these terms out of the way, let\u0026rsquo;s try to understand how exactly it works. Imagine we need to find a solution for a problem. It can be anything, like finding optimal timetable for a university class. Firstly, we need to encode a solution as a series of bytes (their Genetic representation, if you will). Once we have that we can clone the encoded representation to create a generation.\nEach member of the generation will be randomly mutated and then scored based on how well they fit in our constrains set. For example: we might want to have a timetable which leaves just enough break time to eat a quick lunch, but not too much, so that we can go home earlier. This (and similar constrains) might be used to evaluate the value of our new mutated timetable. With each specimen evaluated we leave a few of the best and discard the rest üíÄ.\nThe last step is to mix our special timetables to create new ones to fill the generation again.\nTo mutate, to score, to kill, to breed, to continue the cycle of life. It might sound simple, but in reality it is shockingly efficient in searching the solution space.\nArt from evolution Alright. Now with the theory out of the way, let\u0026rsquo;s conceptualize a program for generating automatic art. Probably it\u0026rsquo;s a good moment to explain the clickbaity summary at the top of this article: the pictures will not draw themselves, the goal is to make a program which will generate art automatically. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be an iterative solution where each cycle is parametrized by the results of its predecessor.\nStep 0: Initialization Before we do anything towards evolution we need to prepare a generation first. So what\u0026rsquo;s our generation size? Let\u0026rsquo;s see if Wikipedia has something insightful to say:\nThe population size depends on the nature of the problem, but typically contains several hundreds or thousands of possible solutions.\n~ Genetic algorithm @ Wikipedia\nWell, that\u0026rsquo;s really not the most helpful answer. üòê\nIt really boils down to this: the more specimen we have, the more memory the program requires and more CPU time to process each generation. On the other hand, the more specimen a generation have, the wider portion of solution space it can search. Whatever the generation size will be, we need to have a prototype - a specimen, which cloned will fill the generation. Since we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with art here, a tabula rasa should be a fitting choice.\nStep 1: Mutation Mutation method greatly affects the end result, so it\u0026rsquo;s imperative to select a right one. Mutation algorithms are usually stateless, meaning modification of each specimen does not affect any other. In each iteration the mutator will introduce a small change into specimens\u0026rsquo; genetic representation. On images it can be, for example: changing random pixels. This works, but the final image looks too detailed (in a bad way).\nNow, the changes does not technically need to be small per se, however applying too big changes might result in overriding a portion of the genome that was making this particular specimen a good candidate, thus resulting in loosing progress achieved by previous generations.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d google \u0026ldquo;generating images with genetic algorithm\u0026rdquo;, you\u0026rsquo;d find that most projects on the subject use geometric shapes when applying mutation. Simple onces, like circles, rectangles, and triangles are a good choice. From these it\u0026rsquo;s rectangles, that can be the most easily represented in code. Having said that let\u0026rsquo;s see how a single specimen might change over a few first iterations.\nAn exemplar of a 6-generation mutation process. Starting with generation 0 - no mutation applied, till generation 5 - five mutations applied.\nEach of the rectangles on that picture represents a random mutation applied onto the image, meaning that all information needed to unambiguously identify a rectangle (width, height, coordinates of one of the corners, and its color) have been randomly generated.\nThe above illustrates the risk of allowing mutations which are not constrained by their impact: the mutation introduced in 1st step has been almost fully overwritten after 5 mutations. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, the result might be beneficial, but overall we want to utilize genome that have evolved in past generations, not to discard it completely.\nStep 2: Scoring Implementing scoring function can be tricky. Basically we need to have a way of mapping each specimen into an integer value. Then with values for all specimens we can calculate a threshold and filter out all images above it. The genetic algorithm does not provide to us any way of determining whether a mutation has been beneficial; that is strictly depends on the implementation. So let\u0026rsquo;s talk about what it is exactly we\u0026rsquo;d like to achieve here.\nThe idea behind generating images through evolution is that we have an ideal to which we\u0026rsquo;re aiming to get as close as possible. An original image, from which will derive a collection of images similar to it, each mutated and scored multiple times. A scoring function could calculate a difference between the original image and the one being currently scored:\n$$ f(O, S) = \\sum_{i=0}^n | O_n - S_n | \\tag{1} $$\nBoth O and S refer to a collection of pixels representing the original image and the current specimen respectively, thus allowing us to index their pixels and calculate a difference between them. This, on its own, isn\u0026rsquo;t the most helpful piece of advice, as it glides over the fact that we a calculating a difference of pixels not numbers, we cannot do arithmetics on them. To fix that we need to be a bit more clever here.\nWe can utilize the fact that pixels are just color, usually represented in RGB notation. Each color in the RGB color space is represented by three numbers from 0 to 255 (each encoding the amount of red, green, and blue). Numbers on their own don\u0026rsquo;t have any meaning, its the context that makes them colors, points, or geometric shapes. If we\u0026rsquo;d interpret these three numbers as coordinates in three-dimensional space, then they would become points. In that case, the difference between two points can be implemented as the distance between then:\n$$ d(A, B) = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2} $$\nAlright üëå. The final thought: this formula calculates the difference between two points in space, but we don\u0026rsquo;t really need the distance, just an indication of how similar the two pixels are. Since calculating a square root on computers is expensive, we can remove that bit and we\u0026rsquo;re left with:\n$$ g(A, B) = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2 \\tag{2} $$\nBy combining (1) and (2) together we get:\n$$ f(O, S) = \\sum_{i=0}^n | (r_2 - r_1)^2 + (g_2 - g_1)^2 + (b_2 - b_1)^2 | $$\nThat was a bit more mathsy that I\u0026rsquo;ve initially anticipated ‚óï_‚óï.\nStep 3: Crossing In the last step the algorithm has to fill up almost emptied generation. This step, quoting Wikipedia, it\u0026rsquo;s:\n[\u0026hellip;] a genetic operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring. [\u0026hellip;] Solutions can also be generated by cloning an existing solution, which is analogous to asexual reproduction.\n~ Crossover (genetic algorithm)\nThere are several ways we can make it work, from naive ones:\ncreate an exact copy of one of the remaining images, create a mutated copy of one of the remaining images, split image into two halves and fill it with a respective half from one of the two parents, to more sophisticated ones:\nfor each pixel pair taken from two parents calculate an arithmetic average and use it to construct a new pixel, for each pixel pair taken from two parents calculate an weighted average and use it to construct a new pixel. The methods mentioned above differ in their complexity, but more importantly, in how fitting specimens they create. It\u0026rsquo;s worth to mention that in opposition to the previous two steps, this one isn\u0026rsquo;t strictly mandatory. The algorithm will still work without it and the generated images will look acceptable. With crossing, however the algorithm generates more fitting specimens, relative to a one without the 3rd step, in the same number of generations.\nWe will take a look at several of crossing methods mentioned above and we will plot scores of their specimens as a function of generation number, to see how well they perform. üìà\nNext steps This is the first article from a series about generating art through genetic algorithms. In the next articles (coming up soon-ish) we\u0026rsquo;ll turn those ideas into Rust code and after that we\u0026rsquo;ll finally make art that makes itself.\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\nSee you around!\nüåä\nTerm coined by me.

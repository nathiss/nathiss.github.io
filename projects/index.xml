&lt;a href="https://busterbenson.com/life-in-weeks">Life in Weeks&lt;/a>. The rules are very similar: each block represents a week in my
life. More significant events are named and might have descriptions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not the end product. I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding entries frequently, but irregularly. My goal in this exercise is to understand
how the sum of forces that have acted upon me has influenced my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>P.S.&lt;/strong> Working on this page has reminded me of
&lt;a href="https://observer.com/2015/06/life-is-a-game-this-is-your-strategy-guide/">&amp;ldquo;Life Is a Game. This Is Your Strategy Guide.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>
by Oliver Emberton. It was recommended to me by a fantastic person and it opened my eyes. I hope you too will find it
both entertaining and insightful. So, for anyone intrigued, happy reading!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
